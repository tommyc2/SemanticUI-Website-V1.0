        <h2>Our History</h2>
        <p>Waterford Football Club (Irish: Cumann Peile Phort Láirge) formerly Waterford United Football Club is an Irish association football club based in Waterford who play in the League of Ireland First Division. The club was founded and elected to the league in 1930. Originally the club was based at the greyhound stadium known as Kilcohan Park, but has now moved to the Waterford Regional Sports Centre. In 2018 the club and its players became fully professional.</p>
        
        <p>Waterford won the league title three times in a row, in 1968,1969 and in 1970. The title was won by Cork Hibernians in 1971 but returned to Waterford in the 1971–1972 season and again in the 1972–73 season. The following season Waterford won the League of Ireland Cup, however failed to regain the league title.</p>
      
        <p>
          After the suffering many years both on and off the pitch, the Club needed a big shake up from top to bottom. After weeks of speculation on social media the Club officially announced that Swindon Town chairman Lee Power had assumed control. Shortly after taking control, he outlined his plan to rebrand the Club from top to bottom, removing 'United' from the Club's name, going back to the original name of Waterford FC. He also wished to change the Club's crest and jersey to something more traditional. On 2 January 2017, the Club announced the new managerial team for the coming season. The new head coach was former player and manager Alan Reynolds and Pat Fenlon was appointed as the Club's new director of football. As the squad started to take shape, the Club officially announced on 20 January 2017 that they would change back to the Club's original identity with a name change to Waterford FC. They also unveiled the new crest which was a modernised version of the Club's first ever crest from 1930. Under the new leadership Waterford FC signed high-profile players and ran the club in a new professional way. The club has developed a strong fanbase over the 2017 season and this was coupled with promotion to the League of Ireland Premier Division.
